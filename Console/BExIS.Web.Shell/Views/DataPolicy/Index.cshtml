<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Introduction</b>
<p class=MsoNormal>The ATTO program has a policy that data should be open to all researchers, with the minimum possible restrictions on immediate use of data within the community. All data collected within the ATTO program by any of its associated projects are in principle free to be used by the community as soon as possible after collection and validation. This data policy is in accordance with the data policy of INPA, which is the institution executing the program, and with the principle that most ATTO research projects are financed with public resources and, therefore, their data are also public.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>This policy refers to primary scientific data collected and to derivatives produced during the analysis and processing of data in the context of scientific experiments under the coordination of the ATTO Program.</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>
    This policy considers:
    <li>
        Full compliance with Brazilian legislation;
    </li>
    <li>
        Cooperation and synergism of ATTO activities, institutional scientific projects and partners officially approved by the ATTO Scientific Committee;
    </li>
    <li>
        That scientific knowledge is dynamic and scalable, largely as a result of interactions of specific interests and dissemination of data and information on a large scale;
    </li>
    <li>
        That the valuation of data and information as an institutional resource improves with its wide use and makes science advance faster;
    </li>
    <li>
        That all data and information obtained from public resources must be publicly available and readily available, in accordance with the Information Access Act (LAI).
    </li>
    <br />
    All raw data must be stored in Brazil in an appropriate way. The ATTO Data Portal will make available the scientific research data of the program, internally and externally, as soon as possible.
</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>This data policy classifies the data into: (1) data generated using the resources of the ATTO program; and (2) data generated by external official collaborators.</p>
<br />

<b>1. Policy for data generated by ATTO</b>
<p class=MsoNormal>(data collected using infrastructure, instruments, technicians and researchers or direct financing with public resources)</p>
<br />

<b>1.1 ATTO data provision policy</b>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>As data provider to the ATTO, you must agree to:</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>a) Provide metadata for each set of data collected and derived, including appropriate acknowledgments;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>b) Provide verification of data quality according to the adopted standard method or recommended protocol;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>c) Make the data publicly available in the ATTO data portal or other infrastructure designated by the ATTO.</p>
<br />

<b>1.2 ATTO data availability policy</b>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>a) The data will be made available to all ATTO participants and publicly through the ATTO Data Portal, according to the Agreement on Fair and Free Use (see section 1.4);</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>b) Data will be made available in the shortest time possible, typically within 3 months, to ATTO Program participants. After QA (Quality Assurance) / Q (Quality Control) tests, calibrations and processing required prior to use, the data will be made publicly available to the general community as soon as possible but no later than 6 months after collection; The only exception is in the case of data used for student theses, in which case the data will be made available no later than 6 months after the thesis defense.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>c) In cases where the data have been submitted to QA / QC and other processing, the processed version of the data will be made available through the ATTO Data Portal (the underlying primary data may only be available upon request submitted to the data provider with notice to the ATTO Data Manager);</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>d) ATTO will provide citation information for all published datasets and value-added products and will assign Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) to published data products.</p>
<br />

<b>1.3 ATTO data utilization policy</b>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>It is the responsibility of the ATTO data user to:</p>
<br />
<p class=MsoNormal>a) Inform the researcher who contributed the data and how you intend to use it before you start using it;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>b) Contact the data provider (collaborator) and offer the opportunity to contribute scientifically and possibly become a co-author of works to be produced;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>c) Notify the data provider when a work based on or derived from the data and documentation is created;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>d) Recognize the data by citing the relevant DOI or article (s), and / or acknowledging the funding for the site's support.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>e) Expressly acknowledge ATTO support in acknowledgments.  Suggested Text: We thank We thank the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA) and the Max-Planck Society for continuous  support. We acknowledge the support by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF contract XXXXXX) and the Brazilian Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação(MCTI/FINEP contract 01.11.01248.00) as well as the Amazon State University (UEA), FAPEAM, LBA/INPA and SDS/CEUC/RDS-Uatumã.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>f) Data should not be forwarded to a third party; those wanting data should register and download through the ATTO Data portal.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal>g) Any cases of conflicts concerning the use of data will be arbitrated by the Scientific Committee of the ATTO after consultation with the parties involved.</p>
<br />
